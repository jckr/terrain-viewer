This demo has been entirely made through ChatGPT.


Here are the rules I followed: 

As a human developer, I get to: 
- Create the scaffold (through create-next-app),
- Decide how to organize functions/methods into files, and reword import/export statements in consequences. 
- Write this readme (though I may ask ChatGPT for its input at the end of the project :) )

Else, 100% of the code must come from responses to prompts:
- When something doesn't work as intended, I cannot fix it directly. I must ask for a fix via prompt. 
- All new features of the code must come from prompts. 
- All the names of methods and variables come as is, except when I specify them in the prompt. 
- I may ask to refactor such or such part of the code, and then I must use the refactored version. I cannot improve or tidy up anything, whether it has functional implications or not. 
- I cannot write a single test. I can only ask via prompt for tests to be generated. And if ChatGPT refuses - there's no test!
